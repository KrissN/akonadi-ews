/**
 *  @brief  Mailbox update subscription manager class
 *
 *  This class is responsible for retrieving update notifications from the Exchange server.
 *
 *  The Exchange server has the ability to incrementally inform the client about changes made to
 *  selected folders in the mailbox. Each update informs about creation, modification or removal
 *  of an item or folder. Additionally Exchange has the ability to notify about free/busy status
 *  updates.
 *
 *  Notifications can be delivered in 3 ways:
 *   - pull (i.e. polling) - the client needs to periodically question the server.
 *   - push - the server issues a callback connection to the client with events (not supported)
 *   - streaming - a combination of pull and push, where the client makes the connection, but the
 *                 server keeps it open for a specified period of time and keeps delivering events
 *                 over this connection (supported since Exchange 2010 SP2).
 *
 *  The responsibility of this class is to retrieve and act upon change events from the Exchange
 *  server. The current implementation is simplified:
 *   - when an item update is received the folder containing the update is asked to synchronise
 *     itself.
 *   - when a folder update is received a full collection tree sync is performed.
 *
 *  The above implementation has a major drawback in that operations performed by the resource
 *  itself are also notified back as update events. This means that when for ex. an item is deleted
 *  it is removed from Akonadi database, but subsequently a delete event is received which will try
 *  to delete an item that has already been deleted from Akonadi.
 *
 *  To reduce such feedback loops the class implements a queued update mechanism. Each time an
 *  operation is performed on the mailbox the resource class is responsible for informing the
 *  subscription manager about it by adding an entry about the performed operation and its subject.
 *  The subscription manager will in turn filter out update events that refer to oprerations that
 *  have already been made.
