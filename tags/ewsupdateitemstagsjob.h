/**
 *  @brief  Job used to update Exchange items wit tag information from Akonadi
 *
 *  This job cycles through all items and updates the Exchange database with tag information from
 *  the items.
 *
 *  The job relies on the tag store to retrieve tag identifiers and names that can be stored in
 *  Exchange. Due to buggy tag implementation in Akonad it can happen that items contain tags not
 *  yet known to the EWS resource. In such case an additional tag fetch job is issues to fetch
 *  information about those tags so that they can be added to the tag store.
