/**
 *  @brief  EWS Tag storage helper class
 *
 *  The role of this class is to maintain a list of tags within an EWS resource and synchronize
 *  the tags between Akonadi items and the Exchange server.
 *
 *  Exchange tag support is rather basic. Tags are not first-class objects like folders or items,
 *  but exist as 'categories' assigned to items. Categories are string labels attached to an item.
 *  Each item can have any number of categories.
 *
 *  Outlook (and OWA) are able to assign colors to tags. This is done outside of Exchange in form
 *  of extra metadata stored in a hidden item in the default Calendar folder. This metadata is
 *  binary and private to Outlook (although some documentation exists about it).
 *
 *  On the Akonadi side tags are first-class citizens and can carry much more information than
 *  Exchange or Outlook private metadata is able to store. In order to store Akonadi tags with all
 *  their content the EWS resource makes use of private properties.
 *
 *  @section tags_global_list Global tag list
 *
 *  Similar to Outlook the Akonadi EWS resource keeps a master list of tags. The list is stored
 *  in a private property in the root mailbox folder. This list contains a list of tags serialized
 *  into Base64 strings.
 *
 *  This list is updated each time tags are added, changed or deleted. It is also retrieved during
 *  startup in order to populate the Akonadi database with tags potentially stored by another
 *  instance of the resource on another machine.
 *
 *  Along with the tag list a version field is stored in form of an integer. Each time the tag list
 *  is updated the version is incremented by one. This field allows another resource instance running
 *  in parallel to detect that the global tag list has changed and synchronize it with Akonadi.
 *
 *  There are no attempts made to synchronize Akonadi and Outlook tag lists.
 *
 *  @section tags_item_list Item tag list
 *
 *  Tags for items are also stored in a private property. The list contains an array of tag unique
 *  identifiers. In parallel to this any update of item tag also populates the category list with
 *  the tag names. This provides a one-way synchronization of tags from Akonadi to Outlook.
 *
 *  @section tags_akonadi_sync Synchronization with Akonadi tags
 *
 *  In the current version of Akonadi tag support is partially broken. One of the problematic issues
 *  is that Akonadi doesn't always tell the resource about the tags it has. This means that the list
 *  of tags can be out of sync with the list on Akonadi side. This causes two problems. One is that
 *  items from Akonadi can have tags that the resource has never seen before. Such tags will need
 *  to be fetched with their full content and written to the server before they can be attached to
 *  the item. Another problem is in the reverse order - an EWS item can contain tags for which the
 *  resource doesn't know the Akonadi tag ID. In order to add such a tag to the Akonadi item the
 *  resource needs to fetch the tags in order to learn their ID.
 *
 *  The EwsAkonadiTagSyncJob job can be used to force a synchronization of Akonadi tags to Exchange.
 *
 *  In future once Akonadi tag support is fixed the explicit synchronization will become obsolete.
